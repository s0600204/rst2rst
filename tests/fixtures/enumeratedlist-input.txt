Enumerated lists
################

In reStructuredText specification, there is no strict convention about enumerated lists.


*****************
Bullet characters
*****************

You can use a variety of characters as first-level identifiers.

Numbers are recognised:

1. first item.
2. second item.

Letters are also recognized:

A. first item.
B. second item.

Roman Numbering is also possible:

I.   first item,
II.  second item,
III. third,
IV.  fourth,
V.   and so on...

This applies to nested lists too.

1. Numeric

  A. Alphabetic

... means the same as:

A. Alphabetic

  1. Numeric

... and, oddly enough:

1. Numeric

A. Alphabetic, seen as a seperate list due to the different type.


***********
Indentation
***********

reStructuredText specification permits various indentation.

1. 1 space between number and text is valid.

And,

2.  2 spaces between number and text is valid too.

And,

3.   3 spaces between number and text is valid too. The more spaces, the less
     readable.

And,

42.                                          numbers indented with an exotic
                                             number of spaces (as an example,
                                             42 spaces) is still valid!

As a result,

1.       You can have 1st level content

  A.     Where text is left aligned with content of 2nd level blocks

    (1)  or

      a. more... It doesn't improve document's readability.


*******
Spacing
*******

You can use an arbitrary number of empty lines between each list item.

1. Zero empty lines,
2. One empty line,

3. Two empty lines,


4. Or more,










5. ... the number list is valid.

Moreover,

A. when several list items span over multiple lines, it becomes quite difficult
   to visually identify the paragraphs if there is no space, or no consistent
   spacing. In order to illustrate this, let's generate some long sentences...
