  This is a literal block with nothing before it in the document.
  It should be output as such as well.

reStructuredText supports code blocks, which produces output that is untouched and not line-wrapped.

There are two ways these might be achieved, the first is to indicate with a double colon ("::"). This may be placed at the end of a line::

  import sys
  import time
  print(f"Python {sys.version} (path: {sys.executable}; implementation: {sys.implementation.name}) running on {sys.platform} at {time.ctime()}.")

Or on a line on its own...

::

  // javascript
  const multi_indentation = {
    'an_array': [
      0, 2
    ],
    'an_object': {
      'letter': 'w',
      'number': 0,
    },
  }

And if a space is given before the double-colon, it is removed from the parsed text, so must be restored when written back as ``rst`` ::

  <?php
  echo "Is this the real life; is this just fantasy?";
  ?>

The second way is to use the ``code`` directive, which has the added benefit of permitting the author to specify which language the code is in:

.. code:: python

  import rst2rst
  # Rock Out!

We also need to test for what happens straight after a title header:

Generic Title
#############

::

  A literal code block straight after a header

And finally:

  Literal code blocks within an indented block comment, both with::

    10 REM Basic code
    20 PRINT "Hello, World!"
    30 GOTO 20

  And without a double-colon at the end

  ::

    body::after {
      content: "Farewell, and thanks for all the fish!";
    }

  And lastly, with a directive:

  .. code:: powershell

    Write-Output("And now for something completely different.")
