reStructuredText supports definition lists.

Alfa
  This first entry has a term, and a definition with a single paragraph.

Baker : Charlie
  This second entry has a term, a classification, and a definition with a
  single paragraph that should be wrapped.

Delta
  This entry has a term, no classifier...

  But more than one paragraph in its definition.

**Echo** : *Foxtrot*
  This entry has inline formatting in its **term**, *classifier*, and
  ``definition``.

And here ends the definition list.
