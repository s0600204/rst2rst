The text of reStructuredText may contain references_ to various things. That right there was an internal link to the title of this document!

This text contains both an `inline internal link`_ to and the _`inline internal link`'s target.

.. _`inline target (with-hyphens)`:

This text points to an `inline target (with-hyphens)`_, which has been placed above this paragraph.

A link to an external resource may be expressed by giving the URI directly (https://pypi.org/),
by expressing it with a name and uri (`python website <https://python.org/>`_),
or by reference, such as `external link`_.

There is also the ability to have an `indirect link`_.

And finally, an `anonymous hyperlink`__. And, because we need to test it, here's a `non-anonymous link`_ to the same location. We then have `another`__ to the same location as before.


.. _external link: https://pypi.org/project/docutils/
.. _indirect link: `external link`_
.. _`non-anonymous link`:
