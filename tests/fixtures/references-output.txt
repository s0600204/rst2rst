The text of reStructuredText may contain `references`_ to various things. That
right there was an internal link to the title of this document!

This text contains both an `inline internal link`_ to and the _`inline internal
link`'s target.

.. _`inline target (with-hyphens)`:

This text points to an `inline target (with-hyphens)`_, which has been placed
above this paragraph.

A link to an external resource may be expressed by giving the URI directly
(https://pypi.org/), by expressing it with a name and uri (`python website`_),
or by reference, such as `external link`_.

There is also the ability to have an `indirect link`_.

And finally, an `anonymous hyperlink`__. And, because we need to test it,
here's a `non-anonymous link`_ to the same location. We then have `another`__
to the same location as before.
